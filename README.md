##GOAL:
# Client Side Dithering in a Browser for creatives

While learning more about git and react, I chose to create a tool for a friend making games requiring 1-bit sprites created from other images. The goal of this project is to offer a quick and easy to use tool that applies a very specific dithering effect to any and all images that can then be downloaded for use. Client Side Dithering means no use of data, and should a user opt to setup this tool as a localhost application, no internet connection is required afterwards either!

The dithering shader used in this project was made by paper-design. [Visit their github](https://github.com/paper-design/shaders).

## Usage

This React App is meant for direct client side creation and saving of a 1-bit stylized version of any image as a .bmp.

The use of this application is 100% free
